# AwesomeMusic
You may never have heard of some of these songs. Or maybe you have.

But either way, I think they are awesome songs, so you should definitely check it out by clicking [here](https://marblelover003.github.io/AwesomeMusic).

There are 47 songs to choose from by various artists, and I have even included the image of the album that each song is from.

When you first load the page, you will see a dropdown on the top-left corner, a time below the dropdown on the left and right, and below that a cyan bar with a black vertical bar on the left.

The times and bars represent where you are in the song down to the millisecond (left time), the song's length down to the millisecond (right time), and your position in the song relative to the song's length (bar). As you get further in the song, the black bar will slowly move to the right and leave a trail of orange behind it.

There are controls below the bar which allow you to navigate songs.

The controls are as follows, in order from left to right. Hover over each image to see what it does.
